If you have been to Berlin ((Maybe two years ago at the last Desktop Summit? ;) )) you know [Alexanderplatz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexanderplatz "Wikipedia entry for Berlin's Alexanderplatz") S+U station.

Since some days ago, huuuuuge ads where put in there. It looks really nice to be surrounded by FOSS ads on the way to work :)

I do really like the "*We work for you not for shareholders*" ((You see, my Deutsch is getting better!)) :D
