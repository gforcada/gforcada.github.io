tl;dr; : <https://live.gnome.org/TranslationProject/Events/IRCMeeting20121006>

During the [Translation BoF meeting](https://live.gnome.org/TranslationProject/Events#GNOME_Translation_Project_BoF.2BAC8-Meeting_at_GUADEC_2012 "Translation meeting BoF at GUADEC") held on [GUADEC](http://www.guadec.org/ "GNOME's anual conference website") we set some [objectives/priorities/things-to-look-at](https://live.gnome.org/TranslationProject/Events/GTPBoFGUADEC2012 "Wiki page on GNOME's wiki with the results of the GUADEC's GTP BoF").

One of them was about doing regular-ish meetings... and you got lucky! There will be one **this Saturday itself!**

So join us on [\#i18n](irc://irc.gnome.org/i18n "GNOME Translation Project IRC channel") channel around 21:00 UTC+2. Details, agenda and everything else (not much more actually ...) on the tl;dr; link :)

See you \*all\* there!
