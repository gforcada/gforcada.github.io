Last Friday the [first WPOD happened around the globe](https://plone.org/events/community/world-plone-office-day-in-berlin-and-worldwide).

Here is what was done on the Berlin gathering:

- Work on plone.app.querystring continued (specially on [pull request 31](https://github.com/plone/plone.app.querystring/pull/31))
- Some work was done on [fixing and improving](https://github.com/plone/buildout.coredev/pull/75) the coredev docs
- A brown bag release [was spotted](https://github.com/plone/plone.app.dexterity/issues/155) on the wild
- jenkins.plone.org nodes use the newer ansible playbook [plone.jenkins_node](https://github.com/plone/plone.jenkins_node/)
  - [a pull request](https://github.com/plone/jenkins.plone.org/pull/106) for it has been created as well
- **lots** of fun and knowledge sharing!

Hopefully other participants around the globe will share their achievements as well!

Are you already planning the next WPOD? Mark it on your calendar **May 29th**.

Happy hacking!
