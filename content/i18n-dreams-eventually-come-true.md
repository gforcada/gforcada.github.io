And even better!

TL;DR; Praise **[Nicolas Delvaux](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-i18n/2013-January/msg00059.html "Mail that he sent to gnome-i18n mailing list")** every time you see him, then go check [Deckard.](http://deckard.malizor.org/ "Online tool to check translations live on UI") An online tool to test translations in Gtk+ (and Glade) based applications. As a translator you can imagine *how* cool is that!!

You know the scenario: you are at GUADEC talking discussing about how to ~~conquer the world~~ make GNOME even better and then you realize a great idea: what if [gtranslator](http://projects.gnome.org/gtranslator/ "gtranslator's website") was able to allow you to open [glade](http://glade.gnome.org/ "glade's website") with the current UI that you are translating with the translations that you are making (( Just like the [synctex gedit plugin updates evince](http://library.gnome.org/users/evince/stable/index.html.en#synctex "Manual describing how synctex works") to show you formatted LaTeX))?

Half a year later, you don't get that, but something really cool, a web based version of that!

Wherever you are Nicolas, if we ever meet, be sure to ask for your beverage of choice, you are more than invited!

Translators out there, be sure to spread this amazing news into your teams!
