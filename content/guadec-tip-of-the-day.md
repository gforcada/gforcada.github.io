As everyone attending [GUADEC](http://www.guadec.org "The GNOME conference") is right now enjoying the party at [Fléda](http://fleda.cz/ "Fléda club"), and Sílvia and me are missing it [for a good reason](http://casament.badall.net "Photos and vídeos of our lovely kid") :) let me give you a tip for the remaining days:

*Are you feeling hungry and looking for a delicious place to eat some arabic/vegeterian food here at Brno?* **Look no longer [Kupé](http://www.kupeorient.cz/ "Kupé restaurant") is what you are looking for!**

Not only the food is great but their stuff is really helpful, they speak perfect English (and the menu is also available in English) and the smoothies are awesome!

Oh and as a late notice:
