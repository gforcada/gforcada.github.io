I'm going to GUADEC (this year called [Gran Canaria Desktop Summit](http://www.grancanariadesktopsummit.org/ "Gran Canaria Desktop Summit webpage")) and thanks to the [GNOME Foundation](http://foundation.gnome.org/ "GNOME Foundation's website") I will be sponsored, so like everyone else sponsorshiped I will be wearing this fancy badge:

See you there at Gran Canaria ;)
