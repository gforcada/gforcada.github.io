Last year around this days I was still living near Barcelona (Molins de Rei actually), some days later, on the November 4th I took a flight from Barcelona to Berlin my new home as of now, and since then, things have happened in a quite fast peace...

We (with [Sílvia](http://silvia.badall.net "Sílvia's blog") obviously!) went there as I got a job offer from [der Freitag](http://www.freitag.de "The website of der Freitag newspaper"), a newspaper, where I help building their website. With such a big move, packing, unpacking, moving, legal stuff and so on kept ourselves busy for quite some time. Thankfully I stayed ~one month with Kat and Dave (million thanks again!!) which helped a lot in getting papers sorted out and finding a flat where to stay :)

German classes started on January (12h per week plus 40h work) and a [wedding](http://galeria.badall.net/v/casament/IMG_0088.JPG.html "A photo from the wedding") in Catalonia on June  30th was the new thing to keep ourselves busy.

Right now German classes are still undergoing, we are going to make a late honeymoon to Japan ((advices to what to see/do are welcome :) )) and we are starting to get ready for the next **small thing: we are expecting a baby!**

We are really excited about it! All these ultrasounds and 3D images that nowadays doctors do and everything really get you the (obviously not like the future-to-be-mom) feeling that something is being cooked in your wife's belly :D

Surely times will keep changing from now on! :D The baby is expected to be around early Spring so (s)he ((We still don't know the gender)) will not get frozen by the Berlin's winter which their parents are still not used to :)

Looking back before coming to Berlin looks really far far away and it's been only one year!
