We have already arrived from the [GCDS](http://www.grancanariadesktopsummit.org/ "Website of the joint event of GNOME & KDE") (Gran Canaria Desktop Summit, the joint event between [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/ "GNOME's website") and [KDE](http://www.kde.org/ "KDE's website ")).

As always it has been a crazy week. Meeting lots of old friends and making lots of new ones, partying, helping organizing everything...

Thanks again to the [GNOME Foundation](http://foundation.gnome.org/ "GNOME Foundation's website") for sponsoring us to come to the GCDS!

- I nearly go to two or three meetings (the GNOME 3.0 status, half of the RMS keynote ... )
- The parties were great, we missed two of them (the Nokia party and the Collabora) but the others (the Canonical and the Igalia's parties) were really great!
  - The jam session and the ice-cream death match during the Igalia's party were a lot of fun :)
- The local team was amazing
- <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Sílvia</span>[Vincent](http://www.vuntz.net/journal/ "Vincent Untz's blog") is as fun as always :)
- Now that Lucas understands Spanish (or at least [he says so](http://blogs.gnome.org/lucasr/2009/07/06/gcds-2/ "Lucas Rocha's blog")) I challenged him to send the [Friends of GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/friends/ "Friends of GNOME website") postcard in Catalan, let's see his Catalan skills :D
  - As a result an hour ago I became a Friend of GNOME :D: [<img src="http://www.gnome.org/friends/banners/monthly.png" data-border="0" alt="Become a Friend of GNOME" />](http://www.gnome.org/friends/)
- Went to the GNOME-Hispano talk and I have already subscribed to the mailing list to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">troll</span>help :)
- [Manolo](http://www.facebook.com/manolopm "Manolos profile on Facebook") took us to see the north west and the center of the Gran Canaria island. It was amazing and it's really beautiful, if you have any chance to go there go to the center of the island!
  - As we were there I talked with him about [guifi.net](http://guifi.net "Guifi.net website") and he was really excited about it. Afterwards I talked with other local guys and all of them see a lot of potential.
  - I talked with [Chema](http://blogs.igalia.com/chema/ "Chema's blog") about gaving a talk about guifi.net in Galicia and he seems to like it also :)
