**WPOD: W**orld **P**lone **O**ffice **D**ay

During this [year's PLOG](http://abstract-technology.com/plog-event-plone-italy "PLOG 2015") I presented the simple idea behind WPOD:

- every last Friday of the month
- meet somewhere (remotely is fine as well, see below)
- hack on [Plone](http://www.plone.org "Plone the Open Source Content Management System") instead of your regular work
- [Rinse and repeat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lather,_rinse,_repeat)

That's it, as simple and as easy as it can be.

Mark on your calendars every last Friday of the month, you have an appointment with the Plone community to bring Plone one step further ahead!

# WPOD in Berlin

Preparations are being made for the first ever WPOD in Berlin that [my company](http://www.freitag.de "der Freitag") will gladly host. If you happen to be around Berlin, please contact me telling that you are coming!

The location is [Hegelplatz 1, 10117 Berlin](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=52.51948&mlon=13.39381#map=19/52.51948/13.39381 "Location of der Freitag offices in Berlin").

You are welcome during all day long. Plonistas are expected to come during the morning, enjoy some lunch together, and hack away until late afternoon.

# WPOD around the world

If you happen to not be in Berlin, fear not, an irc channel will be available (#sprint on irc.freenode.net) so you can feel the same experience as in any other city hosting a WPOD.

# Credit where credit's due

That's not an original idea of mine, nor is something that I thought of myself alone, Philip Bauer already tried to present the very same idea on last year's Plone Conference in Bristol.

Later on, during the [Bycicle sprint](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/bicycle-sprint/project-home "Bycicle sprint coactivate home page") in Berlin, Stefania and I discussed about it and defined the format as it will start with.

Thanks to them for their bright minds and clever ideas!

# Future

Within 10 days the first WPOD will happen, Plonistas will hack/plan/design away and Plone will get better and better.

I hope that other cities and individuals alike will start participating on WPOD, the more we are the bolder the change we will make.

There are some plans to put all the relevant information regarding WPOD on plone.org, either on the current website, or even better on the newer plone.org that is on the making (watch [here](https://github.com/plone/ploneorg.core/issues "Issues to be fixed for the new plone.org website") for tickets ready to be fixed by any of you!).

Happy hacking!

**Update:** [a meetup has been created](http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Plone-Meetup/events/221869443/), please RSVP there.
