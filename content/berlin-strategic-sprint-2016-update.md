In nearly a month the [Berlin strategic sprint 2016](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/berlin-city-sprint-2016/project-home) will start, and finally we can announce where it will be hosted: [IN-Berlin](http://in-berlin.de/) offices!

You can find all information in the link above.

**There are still some spots left,** the venue is big enough to accommodate around 15 to 20 persons, so if you want to join the sprint, **now is the time** to sign up and register. As it's an strategic sprint the Plone Foundation could help with the travel costs if that's an issue for you to attend, contact them!

And best of all: spring has already arrived in Berlin, so we can expect good weather ((hopefully not famous last words)) and a full city to enjoy!

See you all in Berlin!
