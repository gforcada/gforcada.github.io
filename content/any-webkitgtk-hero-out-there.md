I had a draft of this post since two days, as a way to make a call for action to fix [the offending bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67580 "THE bug") once and for all ((A bug about not being able to update the POT file needed to be able to update and generate translations from a module)).

Fast forward, and thanks to my personal new hero of the day, **Martin Robinson**, we, the GNOME Translation Project community can finally start translating in a reliable way WebKitGTK+!

I don't have the honor to know him, but, please, if you happen to see him, buy him his beverage of taste and let me pay the bill, I will gladly do that!

A lot of credit also goes for **Chris Leonard** who has been tirelessly chasing this bug.

Since yesterday the translation world is a bit more shiny :)

Thanks a lot Martin and Chris!
