**GNOME 3.6 is out!**

Go celebrate it! We all made an amazing job!

The [Catalan team](http://l10n.gnome.org/teams/ca/ "GNOME Catalan Translation team page"), just like [lots of other amazing translation teams](http://l10n.gnome.org/releases/gnome-3-6/ "List of GNOME translations teams") did a great job and made it again! Congratulations to all translators who have been working so hard this last weeks. I'm really looking forward to the [GNOME digest](http://blogs.gnome.org/commitdigest/ "GNOME digest blog") about the last week and this one :) On the two other previous weeks was already a lot of activity (1186 and 771 each week)

Now, for GNOME 3.8!
