It probably happened to you, dear reader, every now an then: the new feature you are working on has changes across more than one git repository, so how can this be tested to make sure nothing is broken before merging those nth separate pull requests?

That's what [\#126](https://github.com/plone/jenkins.plone.org/issues/126) was about and finally, thanks to [WPOD](http://gil.badall.net/2015/04/13/wpod/) and [the company](https://www.freitag.de) I work for to allowing me take part of it, it's finally fixed.

[Let us know](https://github.com/plone/jenkins.plone.org/issues) if it does not work as expected!
