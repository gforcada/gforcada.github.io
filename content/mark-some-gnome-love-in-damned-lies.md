Some days ago I was approached by a teacher at [Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Rio Grande do Norte](http://portal2.ifrn.edu.br/curraisnovos "Website of the Brasilian Institute") which plans to make his students [work on Damned-Lies](http://docente.ifrn.edu.br/adorilsonbezerra/disciplinas/2012.1/desenvolvimento-web/projetos "Website describing the course objectives")!

So he needs small bugs that his students could be able to tackle. So pretty please, [submit bugzilla reports](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=damned-lies "Form to submit bug reports to Damned-Lies"), or leave a comment if you are lazy, and mark them with gnome-love.

Hopefully new contributors will be born and Damned-Lies will increase its quality and make translators more productive :)
