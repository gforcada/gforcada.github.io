I wrote a [small guide](https://github.com/plone/jenkins.plone.org/blob/master/docs/source/run-qa-on-package.rst) with a step by step instructions on how to cleanup a package code so that it follows our [Plone style guide](http://docs.plone.org/develop/styleguide/python.html).

To add sugar on top, the packages that are already monitored for it, point you to that same guide, see [it in action](https://github.com/plone/plone.app.discussion/pull/83).

Enjoy!
