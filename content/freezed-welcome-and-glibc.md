### Freeze

[You](https://live.gnome.org/ThreePointFive "Release schedule for GNOME 3.6") [already](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2012-September/msg00017.html "d-d-l announcement about the string freeze") [know](https://live.gnome.org/ReleasePlanning/Freezes "GNOME release planning") it probably, yes, it's freezing time in GNOME!

Developers, please ask for, few ;), string freeze breaks as soon as you notice them, translators go full-steam to translate this lovely GNOME 3.6 that is around the corner!

[Translation teams](http://l10n.gnome.org/releases/gnome-3-6/ "Translations for GNOME 3.6") are working hard to update their translations, and some of them already reached the 100% mark, **congratulations**!!

**Do you speak any language on that list?** There's no better time than now to show your support to GNOME  and to your language and start contributing to it! Please, [join the GNOME translations teams](http://l10n.gnome.org/teams/ "GNOME translations teams") ((Or create a new one!)) so that more and more users can use our beloved Desktop in their loved language!

 

### Central Nahuatl

Just like translating GNOME is a never ending task, everyday strings come and go, the GNOME Translation Project is also and ever growing one!

Today marks the [first translation](http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-icon-theme/commit/?id=fdce338ffdb3eb1087e3157d57008e595feb03c4 "Commit from the first GNOME translation to Central Nahuatl") from [Central Nahuatl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Nahuatl "Wikipedia entry about Central Nahuatl language")! Congratulations to Jorge Becerril and everyone that helped him!

The road to a fully localized GNOME will be long and from time to time a bit hard, but we all, the GTP members, will try to ease the peace as much as possible, but...

### glibc

[glibc is a bit on Central Nahuatl way](http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14501 "Bug reported on glibc to add Central Nahuatl locale data"). For a language that does not have a locale definition on glibc is like it doesn't exist, you can translate GNOME, GIMP, KDE, whichever FOSS software that you like, but without a way to select that language, translating is meaningless.

So, dear interwebs, anyone got a good contact with glibc maintainers to streamline the locale creation process?

Finally, dear translators out there: *Happy translating!*
