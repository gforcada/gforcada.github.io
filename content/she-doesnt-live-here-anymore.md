Roxette - She Doesn't Live Here Anymore

We grew up together, we've been here forever.  
Barefoot in the summer, cold in stormy weather.  
She taught me all there is, like magic and love,  
lots of forgotten words

But now, she doesn't live here anymore.  
She's off and she's gone, she doesn't live here anymore.  
I'm sorry that's all there is to it, I'm sorry that's all

She dressed just like a painter, a female street Picasso  
and I, I will remember the heaven in her laughter.  
And the scent of her sweet perfume when we made love  
under an August moon

But now, she doesn't live here anymore.  
She's off and she's gone, she doesn't live here anymore.  
She's gone since long, so long, she doesn't live here anymore.  
She took off and left home, she doesn't live here anymore.

I'm sorry that's all there is to it, I'm sorry that's all. That's all.
