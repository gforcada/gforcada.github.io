I'm glad you asked, because there's plenty of them, for example these ones:

[Move core packages' translations to plone.app.locales](https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone/issues/983)

There a step by step tutorial on the first message and plenty of packages to choose from.

[World Plone Office Day](http://gil.badall.net/2015/04/13/wpod/) is 3 weeks away only so, whether you are hosting one office day or you are thinking of to attend it, be sure to get a list of easy tasks to do for newcomers.

Happy hacking!
