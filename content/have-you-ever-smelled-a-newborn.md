That's what the midwife asked me 20 minutes later after Ona ((ocean weave in Catalan, and a friend also told us that means *beautiful* in Euskera)), our first daughter, was born (on April 3th).

And, no, I haven't smelled any newborn, but man, they smell so great!!! ((no wonder why cosmetic companies go after placentas...))

Both mama and kid are doing fine, circa usual newborn issues :)

To cope up with all advices/tips that everyone is giving you about rising kids, we found a great book ((advised by my sister)): [Kiss Me!: How to Raise Your Child with Love](http://www.amazon.com/Kiss-Me-Raise-Your-Child/dp/1780660103 "Book at Amazon"). Which is the English version of this other one (in Spanish and also longer): [Comer, amar, mamar](http://www.casadellibro.com/libro-comer-amar-mamar-guia-de-crianza-natural-contiene-besame-muc-ho-un-regalo-para-toda-la-vida-mi-nino-no-me-come/9788484608202/1484197 "Spanish book").

It's amazing!! :)
