*Warning that's a rant about Spanish voting system, skip it if not interested.*

First of all the facts:

- in [Catalonia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia "Wikipedia entry about Catalonia") there were elections this past November 25th (2012)
- as we are currently living abroad (Germany ((Google Maps says ~1900km by car, and a flight takes 2 and a half hours from Barcelona to Berlin))) we need to register in a special census to be able to vote
- the last day available to register on that register for those elections was October 15th (I could make it, SÃ­lvia couldn't)
- I got **within a weeks time** a confirmation letter (you know that dead tree thing that postmans deliver every day) that I was successfully register and that I should because starting from October 30th to November 3th I was supposed to get the actual envelope and all the papers and forms to be able to cast my vote from Berlin itself
- ...
- ...
- ... (yes, that's a fact I was just waiting, waiting some more, and then even some more)
- elections where held, people living in Catalonia could vote as usual, but not me
- lots of Catalans living abroad complained that they didn't get the envelope and forms to be able to vote, some got their envelope and papers one or two weeks **after** the actual elections date ((You are supposed to cast your vote, when living abroad, at maximum nearly two weeks **before** the elections are held, so that your vote can be counted as well)) )
- fast forward to January 9th of 2013 ((nearly two months after I should got the actual envelope and forms to vote)) I got a new letter (another dead tree thingie) saying something random about the elections, but was still not the envelope and forms to vote!

So looking at the facts... should I still have some hope left that one of my new years resolutions (be able to vote) will come true?

As a hacker and computer literate I know that it could be feasible to do electronic voting, or even going to the embassy ((\<sarcasm\>Nice and friendly btw. the ones on the Spanish embassy in Berlin, \</sarcasm\>)) or even keeping the good old post system, if there was any interest in using it.

The most amazing thing about it is that nowadays, and we have done that already quite a few times, we wake up on the morning in Berlin, take breakfast, pack some stuff in our backpacks and within 4-5 hours (just 2:30 hours of plane) we are in Barcelona chatting happily with our family and friends.

How come the voting envelope hasn't still arrived at my home in Berlin?!
