After a Plone Conference there's always a lot of energy and willingness to move Plone one step forward.

The testing and CI team in Plone is no different, and for that I created a [Doodle](http://doodle.com/poll/q35ixzrvye7tntfg) to see who is interested and what would be the best time to meet during next week.

If you are interested in the team, or know anyone who would be, please share that link and join the meeting!
