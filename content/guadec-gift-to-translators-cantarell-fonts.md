I just updated [l10n.gnome.org](http://l10n.gnome.org "GNOME translation statistics website") to use [Cantarell](http://git.gnome.org/browse/cantarell-fonts "GNOME 3 default font"), so it gets pretty just before [GUADEC](http://guadec.org/ "GNOME's anual conference") :)

I just became the [new maintainer of Damned-Lies](http://git.gnome.org/browse/damned-lies/commit/?id=4770342ea35617f51120476c732600307c070b8f "Commit on D-L when Claude adds me as a maintainer") ((Thanks Claude for all the hard work!)), so as I don't feel too confident on my Django skills I will try to keep it alive and make it even more and more useful. I have plenty of ideas which some will be discussed at my talk at GUADEC, be sure to come! ([Andre](http://blogs.gnome.org/aklapper/2012/07/19/guadec-conference-next-week/) I'm looking to you ;)

Anyway, see you all at GUADEC!!
