One thing that always get on my nerves with Javascript is that it was a pain (until today for me) to get from an HTML element to the actual javascript that runs once you hover, click, etc that element.

I'm a visual kind of guy so my rationale was:

- I see a button on a webpage that does something that smells like *javascripty*
- I open firebug and select that element
- I expect to have some kind of panel/hint about the events that are registered for that element without success :S

Today, tired of it, I start looking for a solution, and I found an amazing one, let me introduce you [**visual events 2!**](http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2 "Visual events 2")

It's a bookmark that you place on your browser and if you click on it the page gets blue rectangular overlays on all elements that have a javascript event handler!

But not only that, if you hover over one of those boxes you will see what I was expecting from the beginning: the code that is executed and where it lies (which file and line).

**Brilliant!**
