In less than a week Plonistas will be [meeting in Berlin](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/berlin-city-sprint-2016/summary) to sprint on [Plone](http://plone.org).

The topic this time is to continue the long endeavor to cleanup and slim down our stack, Zope included.

Thanks to [IN-Berlin](http://in-berlin.de/) we will sprint at their offices. All information on how to get there is on the [sprint page](http://www.coactivate.org/projects/berlin-city-sprint-2016/project-home).

The main communication channels with the sprints will be the usual [\#sprint IRC channel](https://plone.org/support/chat) (on freenode) and we will try to maintain a hangout channel open as well (we will provide the link later on).

On social networks you can try to keep an eye on [\#berlinsprint](https://twitter.com/hashtag/berlinsprint) hashtag.

Happy hacking!
